I'm a professor at the University of Sydney and I lead the Integrative Ecology Lab there.

My research focuses on how biodiversity responds to the unique pressures of urbanisation, identifying how we can better support nature in cities. I study the biology and ecology of iconic birds, insects and spiders in urban environments, and how they interact with the humans who share it with them. My recent work also examines how human activities in cities affect ecosystem health, and conversely how human wellbeing is affected by nature in cities.
