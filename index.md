I'm a professor at the University of Sydney and I lead the Integrative Ecology Lab there.  My work focuses on nature in cities,integrating human dimensions of ecology and natural history in urban environments.

My work focuses on nature in cities, integrating human dimensions of ecology and natural history to examine examining how nature thrives, dies, and persists in hostile environments. I study the biology and ecology of iconic birds, insects and spiders in urban environments, and how they interact with the humans who share it with them. My recent work also examines how human activities in cities affect ecosystem health, and conversely how human wellbeing is affected by nature in cities.  

Over the years I have developed an enthusiasm for sharing my research and fondness for insects, spiders, and birds with the wider public whenever I can, in as many ways as I can.
