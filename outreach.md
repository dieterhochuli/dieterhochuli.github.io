I'm always keen to  I talk to as many people as I can about the work we do.  So here's some stuff about my outreach work.  

Most of them are a function of answering the phone/email and agreing to talk about... something. One thing I've learned is that outreach isn't for everyone, but if you can do it you should.  Lots of people want to hear our stories and have a genuine interest in them.  




Here are some videos of my talking about things
